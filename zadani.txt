--------- Introduction --------- 
The initial task from the progtest system: 
    Write a graphic game in the genre of Tower Defense.
    This game should be able to (main points):
    1. Read game maps and characteristics of enemies/towers from ﬁles.
    2. Implement several strategies for passing the game map.
    3. Implement score statistics and the interaction of towers and enemies.

My deﬁnition of the task:
    The style of the game will resemble the classic arcade 2D pixel game of the old days of the dawn 
    of the gaming industry - “Battle city”.

    Tanks will be used as enemies, turrets will be used as defense towers.

    The action takes place on an 8 by 8 tile map (like a chessboard). 

    The game map will be read from a ﬁle, where it is deﬁned by a sequence of 64 characters, each of 
    which encodes a speciﬁc tile of the ﬁeld.



--------- Game objects --------- 
Tile:
    The tile of the ﬁeld can be of the type:

    - Road (Along which the tanks will move)
    - Wall (Accordingly, no one will move there, there will be no interaction with this cell)
    - Place to install a turret (Where it will be possible to put a certain turret)

    The tile is deﬁned as 80 x 80 pixels for a game (virtual) screen of 640 x 720 pixels.

Tank: 
    As already written, tanks act as enemies. They move, take damage, have diﬀerent characteristics, which means this is a great opportunity to apply polymorphism.

    The tank can be of type:

    - Light
    - Medium
    - Heavy

    They all differ in the amount of health, speed, sprites (game textures), ways to bypass the game map, and so on.

Turret: 
    The turret can be:

    - Firebird
    - Freeze
    - Smoky

    They all differ in damage, reload speed, sprites, external effects, cost, the way they interact with the tank, and so on.



--------- Game goal --------- 
The goal of the game:
    The game is an arcade game where, due to the limitations of the 8 x 8 playing ﬁeld, sooner or later the player will be defeated.

    Therefore, the goal of the game is incredibly simple:

    Hold out as long as possible, get as many points as possible, kill as many tanks as possible, place turrets as eﬀectively as possible.
